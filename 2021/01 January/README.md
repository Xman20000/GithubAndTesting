Yes i know it's stupid. But I'm stuck at odds with my brain and haven't really won... For like 4 years... And I don't really know what to do. But I'm trying again... Just been stuck in a horrid cycle all this time.

I'm tired of this bullshit cycle...
And it's my own cycle... I know it is...
I fucking hate it, It's been a huge fucking waste of time.
And I still wait for the day to overcome this.

I don't even feel like writeing this, or posting this, I'm too self absorbed right now to care though, I'll just scream into the void... I'm just at a loss with myself for too long...

I just only want to be better...
I hope I change for the better...
I will listen, I'd like help to be better...
I am not that great at social stuff, but I need to be better...
